- 👋  Hi, I’m Kyle Glover, a graduate from UCSC who majored in Computer Science. Right now though, I've been working for a masters at San Jose State in software engineering.
- 👀  I’m a huge nerd, looking to nerd out with other nerds, especially if it involves computer wizard shenaigans!
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on really just about anything at this point; as long as I get to work on something neat with awesome people, those are the only boxes I need checked off. Also currently looking for a job right now too, so there's that.
- 📫  You can reach me on Discord (CockyKyle#8951) or on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-e-glover), plenty happy to meet new people and learn from them!
- ⚙️  A lot of what I have been working on recently has been experimenting with how I want to make apps, home lab security, and learning Rust to contribute to The Oracle Engine, a web app project that I have been wanting to contribute to for some time now.
